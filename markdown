lists:

Sometimes you want numbered lists:
1. one 
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:
* Start a line with a Star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
        - like this
        - And this

Images:

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

Headers & Quotes:

# Structured Documents h1 heading 

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your Documents. start lines with a # to create headings.
Multiples ## in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

## This is a third-tier heading
You can yse one # all the way up to ###### six for different heading sizes.

if you'd like to quote someone, use the > charcter before the line :

> coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway

Code:

There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown.
If you  have inline code blocks, wrap them in ackticks: `var example = 'true`. if you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

if(isAwesome){
    return  true
}

Github also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```

if(isAwesome){
    return true
}

``
and if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include tha language:
```javascript
if(isAwesome){
    return true
}


Github suppots many extras in Markdown that help you reference and link to people. if you ever want to direct a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with an @ symbol: hey @kneath - love your sweater!

Bute I have to admit , tasks lists are my favorite:

- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item
when you include a task list in the first comment of a n Issue, you will see a helpful progress bar in your list of issues. It works in Pull Requests, too!

And of course emoji!
